# Zapier Kutt Integration

Allows you to use [Kutt.it](https://github.com/TheDevs-Network/kutt) as a URL shortener with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). May require a subscription and the [Code by Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/code/integrations) Action.

Read the [Zapier Documentation](https://zapier.com/help/create/code-webhooks/use-javascript-code-in-zaps) for more info about this action.
